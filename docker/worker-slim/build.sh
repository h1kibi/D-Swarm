# Build the SLIM muteki worker image (plain Ubuntu + reverse-connector + 3 agent CLIs).
# A lightweight alternative to docker/worker/build.sh for FAST testing — same two steps:
#   1) cross-compile the Go runtime-agent (supervisor) to docker/worker-slim/runtime_agent
#      (the docker build context — COPY ./runtime_agent resolves relative to it).
#   2) docker build the amd64 image, tagging both the version and :latest.
#
# Usage: ./docker/worker-slim/build.sh [repo] [version] [arch]
#   repo:    image repository (default: muteki-worker-slim; e.g. ghcr.io/fishcodetech/muteki-worker-slim)
#   version: version tag       (default: 0.2.5)
#   arch:    amd64 | arm64     (default: HOST arch — arm64 on Apple Silicon)
# Tags built: <repo>:<version> AND <repo>:latest.
#
# Unlike the Kali image (pinned amd64 because ghidra/sage are amd64), the slim image
# has NO arch-locked tooling — the only baked binary we control is the Go runtime_agent
# (GOARCH), the engine CLIs are arch-agnostic JS (npm) + an arch-detecting cursor
# installer. So it builds NATIVELY for the host arch by default: on an Apple-Silicon
# mac that means arm64, which AVOIDS QEMU emulation entirely (emulated amd64 apt on
# arm64 Docker Desktop fails GPG verification — "invalid signature"), and is faster to
# build AND run locally. Pass `amd64` as the 3rd arg to force parity with the Kali
# image (e.g. to push a slim tag a remote amd64 host will pull).
#
# Run a slim swarm with it:
#   MUTEKI_WORKER_IMAGE=muteki-worker-slim:latest ./run.sh …
# Keeps the EXACT in-container path contract as the Kali image, so no code change.
