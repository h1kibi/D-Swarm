"""Container execution backend — run CLI workers INSIDE a Docker container that
ships the full Kali/CTF toolchain, so workers have a consistent tool environment
regardless of the host.

Architecture: ONE long-lived container PER RUN. Inside it, an in-container
supervisor (`runtime_agent`, the Runtime Control Plane — DESIGN_worker_image_clean
_rebuild.md §7-11) is PID1/ENTRYPOINT and forks workers on demand. The host talks
to the supervisor over a per-run Unix domain socket (the `rcp` backend, default).

  - ONE container per RUN (`muteki-run-<safe_run_id>`), from the tool image. In rcp
    mode the supervisor IS the container's main process (no `sleep infinity`).
  - The run's host workspace is bind-mounted at /home/kali/workspace, so worker
    products survive teardown and sibling workers share board/shared_graph via the
    SAME volume. A second mount exposes the control socket dir; a third exposes the
    credential-account projection.
  - A worker is started by asking the supervisor (StartWorker over the socket); the
    supervisor forks it as the kali user (with sudo), applies a wall-clock cap, and
    streams its stdout/stderr back verbatim. Per-worker control (kill/pause/resume)
    is a Signal op the supervisor routes to that worker's process group — so killing
    or pausing one worker never touches a sibling, and there's no host-side PPID/
    pgid/cmdline-sentinel追溯 to sever (the reason the original docker-exec shared-
    container attempt was fragile; the supervisor owning the PIDs fixes it cleanly).
  - Whole-run teardown = `docker rm -f` the single container (its PID namespace
    takes the supervisor + every worker with it).

LEGACY fallback (`container_dockerexec`): the previous model shelled `docker exec`
per worker from the host into a `sleep infinity` container, with `pkill -f <tag>`
for control. Kept behind MUTEKI_WORKER_BACKEND=container_dockerexec as an emergency
escape hatch (to be removed after the rcp path settles); see `_DockerExecBackend`.

The two public entry points mirror cli_driver.run_cli / run_cli_streaming so the
solver swaps backends with one parameter. The solver's _signal_proc prefers our
proc wrapper's _container_signal (STOP/CONT/KILL).
