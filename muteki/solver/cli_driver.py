"""Shelled-CLI worker drivers — claude / codex as full agentic executors.

Why: the local DeepSeek code-driven kernel (one run_python tool-call per step)
lacks the execute→observe→refine depth to actually land an exploit. EXP-AB proved
a shelled `claude -p` solves challenges the code-driven swarm misses, and its flag
still passes the real provenance gate. So we delegate a focused intent to a CLI
agent that runs its OWN shell loop, and gate its output exactly as before.

Each driver is a thin per-CLI adapter: it builds the argv + manages a session id so
the single conclude-fallback turn (on a timeout) can resume the SAME session — there
is no multi-turn resume loop; a worker runs one execute pass and is then discarded.
We run bare-host against the
SUBSCRIPTION CLIs (full-strength model — the reason it solves). codex is included
but may be usage-limited; the swarm degrades to claude-only when a driver's
healthcheck fails.

This module is pure (builds argv + parses output); the solver runs the subprocess.

# ── engine binary resolution ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# A worker shells `subprocess.run(["claude", ...])`, which resolves the FIRST
# `claude` on PATH. On this host (and easily on others) that can be a BROKEN
# third-party repackage — e.g. `@cometix/claude-code`, a Node "restored" build
# that crashes at parse time (`SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier`) under an
# older Node, never reaching the CLI. A worker pointed at it dies before it can
# solve, and the healthcheck just sees a non-zero exit and silently degrades the
# swarm. So we DON'T trust bare PATH order: resolve each engine to a real,
# runnable OFFICIAL binary and pin it.

#   1. explicit override  — env MUTEKI_CLAUDE_BIN / MUTEKI_CODEX_BIN (operator wins)

    `env`, if given, OVERLAYS os.environ for the subprocess.

    Runtime control (dispatcher control over a stateless worker subprocess):
      - `cancel_event`: when set, the subprocess is KILLED immediately (not just
        the asyncio task — that left the CLI agent running, see bug #2). A watcher
        thread kills it the instant the event fires, even if the model is mid-think
        and stdout is quiet (the per-line loop alone could wait minutes).
      - `on_proc`: invoked once with the live Popen so the caller can SIGSTOP /
        SIGCONT it for HITL pause/resume. The worker keeps the same PID, so a paused
        agent is genuinely frozen, not killed.
      - `paused_event`: set by the caller while the worker is SIGSTOP-frozen (HITL
        pause). The timeout is computed against wall-clock MINUS time spent paused, so
        a long operator pause can't trip the turn timeout and mislabel a deliberately
        frozen worker as `timed_out` (M7).
      - `steer_event`: like cancel, but means END THIS PASS without marking the worker
        dead — an operator hint/redirect/focus cuts the current pass so the swarm can
        respawn a worker that picks up the queued guidance. The subprocess is killed
        and res.steered=True; there is NO resume loop (single-shot), so the caller does
        not reconnect — steered only keeps the session id from being downgraded.
        cancel_event takes PRECEDENCE: a stop during a steer must still die.

    `container`: if a ContainerHandle is given, the worker runs INSIDE that
    isolated Docker container; all control (cancel/steer/pause) routes in via
    `docker exec kill`. None → host subprocess (default, unchanged).
